# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
As a coding bootcamp student, in order to learn basic coding tools, concepts, and best practices such as GitHub, VS Code, the Git Flow, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics, I created this webpage both as a means of practicing new skills and as a place to track the information I am learning.

Ensure the "Console" tab is selected in the panel that appears either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
