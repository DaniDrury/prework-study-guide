        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that work together to provide content and the basic formwork for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Content Elemnts: Text, Image, Header, List</li>
          <li>Element types used to divide and describe a page: Meta-related elements, Content Division elements, Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage to help the browser render the page correctly. Not visible to users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The footer element usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>HTML Attribute: defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are alwyays defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "charset" elements sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The "http-equiv" element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The "viewport" element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>Header elements range from "h1" to "h6" and should be used in order. The "h1" header should only be used once on each page.</li>
          <li>Other common Body elements include: "p" for paragraph, "ul" for an unordered, or bulletpointed list, "ol" for an ordered list, and "li" for list items.</li>
          <li>Image elements, "img", are used to display images and contain various attributes such as "src" defining the location of the image.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascaiding Style Sheets (CSS) defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS - code added to the HTML file, applying to a specific HTML tag to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Example of Inline CSS: Using the "style" attribute to change the color of a single "h1" heading - ie. "h1 style="color:red;""</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet: embeds an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet: The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements,
             to style multiple elements in the page code. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External Style Sheet: The most common way to style a page. Preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS
             rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>External Style Sheet: Link the CSS file to the HTML file using the "link" element placed in the HTML's "head".</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class Attributes: Assign styling to specific elements by using Class Attributes. To designate a selector as a class selector use a ".".</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git checkout main: moves working branch to main.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds files from the working branch to the stage area.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit message": commits files from your local environment. Like a local save.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls the current updated main files from GitHub to local environment.</li>
          <li>git push origin "branch/name": pushes the branch from local environment to GitHub.</li>
          <li>The GitFlow:

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements, like IF statements, can be used to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>Variables that store more than one value are called arrays.</li>
          <li>Arrays can store values of varying data types.</li>
          <li>Array values are tracked by indexing using brackets and starting with the value 0.</li>
          <li>A FOR loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>FOR loops contains 3 important statements: starting point for the loop, condition, iteration mechanism.</li>
          <li>A Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task that must be "called" in order to execute.</li>
          <li>First you define the Function by using the FUNCTION keyword followed by the unique name of the Function and parentheses, then with executable code 
            within curly brackets.</li>
          <li>To Call the function, simply type the name of the function where you want the function executed with your code.</li>
